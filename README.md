# Credit Risk Modeling

This project measures the credit risk analysis on a loan data available on kaggle. The loan data is first preprocessed from its raw form to an informed manner. The process called data_preprocessing can be find at "risk_modeling/src/data_preprocessing.py". 
The data have been organised into dummy variables, categorical variables, to understand the patterns in data.

# To measure the credit risk, following three different terms have been calculated.
 Credit risk = PD (Probability of Default) *
               LGD (Loss at given Default) *
               EAD (Expected loss at Default)

  To predict the three different terms different machine learning algorithms have been deployed such as logistic regression, linear regression etc.
